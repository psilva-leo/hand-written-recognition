Handwritten Digit Recognition

This project is a simple implementation of two popular machine learning algorithms: k-nearest and perceptron (single layer). The project is divided into 3 parts: training and testing (part1.m), features extraction (part2.m) and perceptron (perceptron.m).

A report is available explaining the whole project, explanation of the algorithms and of the code.
